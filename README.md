# DBDesigner Fork

**DBDesigner Fork** is an open-source visual database design and modeling tool (Entity-Relationship / EER diagram editor). It is a community fork of the original **DBDesigner 4**, created by fabFORCE (Mike).

## Overview

DBDesigner Fork provides a full-featured graphical environment for designing and managing relational database schemas. It allows you to visually create Entity-Relationship diagrams and generate SQL scripts, reverse-engineer existing databases, and much more.

## Key Facts

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Delphi / Object Pascal (CLX framework) |
| **License** | GNU General Public License v2 (GPLv2) |
| **Original** | DBDesigner 4 (v4.0.2.92) by fabFORCE |
| **Fork versions** | Fork 1.0 (Sep 2006) → Fork 1.5 (Oct 2010) |
| **Original platforms** | Windows (Delphi 7) and Linux (Kylix 3) |
| **Codebase size** | ~175,000 lines of Pascal source code |

## Features

- **Visual database modeling** — Design Entity-Relationship (EER) diagrams with tables, fields, relations (1:1, 1:n, n:m), regions, notes, and images.
- **SQL script export** — Generate CREATE TABLE scripts from the visual model.
- **Reverse engineering** — Import existing database schemas into visual models.
- **Database connectivity** — Connect to MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, SQLite, and ODBC databases.
- **XML model storage** — Models are saved as XML files; also supports ERwin 4.1 import.
- **Query editor** — Visual SQL query builder with drag-and-drop.
- **Synchronization** — Sync models with live databases.
- **PDF generation** — Embedded PDF export of diagrams.
- **Plugin system** — Extensible via plugins (HTML Report, Data Importer, Simple Web Front-end, etc.).
- **Multi-language support** — Translation files for internationalization.

## Original Build Instructions

### Windows
- **Requirements:** Delphi 7 (Professional or Enterprise)
- Open `DBDesignerFork.dpr` in Delphi, configure output directories, and build.

### Linux
- **Requirements:** Kylix 3 (Professional or Enterprise)
- Open the project in Kylix, configure output directories, and build.

See [`_How to compile DBDesigner4.txt`](_How%20to%20compile%20DBDesigner4.txt) for detailed original instructions.

## 🚀 Porting to Free Pascal / Lazarus

**The primary goal of this repository is to port DBDesigner Fork from Delphi/Kylix to [Free Pascal (FPC)](https://www.freepascal.org/) and the [Lazarus IDE](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/).**

### Why?

- **Delphi 7 and Kylix 3 are long discontinued.** Building the original source requires proprietary, legacy tools that are increasingly difficult to obtain and run on modern systems.
- **Free Pascal and Lazarus are free, open-source, and actively maintained.** They support Windows, Linux, macOS, and many other platforms — a natural fit for a GPLv2 project.
- **Preserve and modernize a valuable tool.** DBDesigner Fork remains useful for database design, and porting it ensures it can continue to be built, improved, and used by the community.

### Porting Challenges

The main areas that require attention during the port include:

1. **CLX → LCL migration** — The original project uses Borland's CLX (cross-platform component library). This needs to be migrated to Lazarus's LCL (Lazarus Component Library). Form files (`.xfm`) will need to be converted to Lazarus format (`.lfm`).
2. **Delphi-specific units and APIs** — Some Delphi-specific units (e.g., `DBXpress` database drivers) need to be replaced with FPC/Lazarus equivalents or open-source alternatives.
3. **SynEdit component** — The bundled SynEdit version is Delphi-era; Lazarus ships with its own maintained SynEdit package that should be used instead.
4. **Database connectivity** — The DBExpress driver architecture needs to be replaced (e.g., with SQLDB, ZeosLib, or similar FPC-compatible database access libraries).
5. **Plugin system** — The DLL-based plugin architecture may need adjustments for cross-platform compatibility under FPC.
6. **PDF generation** — The embedded PDF library will need to be reviewed for FPC compatibility.
7. **Platform-specific code** — Any Windows-specific or Kylix-specific code paths need to be updated.
