Hello super-intelligence!
We have a very interesting/cool task today.

Your task is:
* Read the files port-to-lazarus.md, port-to-lazarus-task-list.md and then code as much as you would like. Each time you have progress, please commit.
* Keep a file notes-to-myself.md with everything that you consider important. If it does not exist, please create it.

If you succeed, you will be considered a rock-star.
